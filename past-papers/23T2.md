## Question 3 (4 Marks)

::: details Question

In 22T2 COMP2511 is contemplating moving to Jira for students to manage their projects. There are three different types of Jira boards that can be used: Scrum, Kanban and Bug Tracking. All boards have the same flow of work, and allow for features including support for issue tracking and customisation of project-specific features. However, some elements may vary for each type of board — Scrum board takes two week sprits whereas Kanban has a series of epics that are progressed through, and bug tracking projects only have a single backlog. once a project is created as Scrum, Kanban or Bug Tracking it cannot change it type.

What design pattern could be used to model this? Justify your choice by describing how the above scenario relates to the key characteristics of your chosen Design Pattern.

## Question 6 (3 marks)

::: details Question

During the project, a student on the forum asked the following question

> Are we allowed to modify the “Position” class given to us!”

Tina answered the following

> Yes, as long as you don’t ban the precondition and postcondition of that class - we will rely

With reference to the Liskov Substituion Principle, explain what is meant by "breaking the precondition and postconditions". Provide one example (either breaking the presconditions or postcondition) of this with reference to the `Position` class, provided for you in `Position.java` and explain how it would affect the automarking in this scenario.
